Observation: 国际会计控股有限公司 截至2009年12月31日止年度财务报表  本国际会计控股有限公司财务报表范例旨在说明国际财务报告准则（IFRS）的列报和披露要求，同时包括被视为最佳实务的额外披露，特别是那些作为特定准则的说明性示例的披露。  本财务报表范例假设国际会计控股有限公司在过去都是按照国际财务报告准则编制财务报表。因此，国际会计控股有限公司并非国际财务报告准则的首次采用者。企业首次采用国际财务报告准则作为其财务报表编制基础的有关特定要求，读者应参阅《国际财务报告准则第1号—首次采用国际财务报告准则》，并参照德勤编制的《列报和披露核对表》内有关《国际财务报告准则第1号》的部分，以了解适用于首次采用者的特定披露要求（注：本财务报表范例（中文版）并未包括相关列报和披露核对表的中文翻译）。  本财务报表范例并未考虑当地法律或法规的要求。财务报表编制者需确保在选用国际财务报告准则允许的会计处理方法时，不会与当地法律或法规相抵触（例如：本财务报表是采用《国际财务报告准则第16号——不动产、厂场和设备》中可选用的重估价模式，但某些国家/地区并不允许对资产进行重估）。同时，当地法律或法规等可能会规定一些国际财务报告准则并没有要求披露的事项（例如：董事酬金的某些内容），因此，财务报表编制者在采用本财务报表范例时，应按当地法律或法规的要求作出适当修改。  财务报表范例并不包括母公司的单独财务报表，但企业可能因为当地法律或法规的要求而编制单独财务报表，又或是企业自行编制单独财务报表。如果企业按照国际财务报告准则编制单独财务报表，应遵循《国际会计准则第27号——合并财务报表和单独财务报表》的要求。母公司的单独财务报表包括综合收益表、财务状况表、权益变动表、现金流量表和财务报表附注。  本财务报表范例的建议披露事项与相关准则及解释公告相应段落的要求建立了交叉索引。如果国际会计控股有限公司采用了相关准则或解释公告，则一般索引至该准则或解释公告的最新版本（除非另有规定）。因此，有关《国际财务报告准则第3号》、《国际会计准则第1号》和《国际会计准则第27号》的索引分别是指向《国际财务报告准则第3号》（2008年修订版）、《国际会计准则第1号》（2007年修订版）和《国际会计准则第27号》（2008年修订版）。  本财务报表范例就采用若干新的及已修订的准则（有关详情，请参见财务报表附注2）的影响作出说明。  《国际会计准则第1号》（2007年修订版）修订了若干术语，包括财务报表标题（如，“资产负债表”的名称变更为“财务状况表”）。本财务报表范例均采用修订后的术语编制而成。然而，财务报表编制者应注意这些新标题并不强制要求在财务报表中使用。  对于综合收益表和现金流量表的列报，本财务报表范例分别就国际财务报告准则允许选用的列报方式作出说明。财务报表编制者应根据其情况选用最恰当的列报方式。  请注意，在本财务报表范例内会经常出现金额显示为零的单项，其目的是说明那些虽然并不适用于国际会计控股有限公司，但在实务上却经常会遇到的项目。这并不表示本财务报表范例会列示所有可能的披露，亦不应理解为在实务上所有主体都需要列报该等金额为“零”的项目。
