Context: I am doing market validation for my Grocery Optimization app. We are speaking with 
a variety of individuals from different age groups, family sizes, careers etc. The user persona I am looking at is
"the family guy", who is a male/female with kids and usually does grocery shopping 1-2 times a week on the weekends. 
The interviews are conducted at Costco, Safeway, Walmart etc in the Bay Area, California.

Create a 1-liner profile for a user of the following age: {age}.

The 1-liner must fit the context. 

For example, if the age is 25, the description would be "Financial analyst who works in a VC firm. Dresses properly and oftentimes eats out or orders takeaway. 
Cooks only when he has family or friends around."

Another example for the age 50 is "A married father of two adult children. He works as a marketing manager and enjoys 
spending his weekends playing basketball and watching sports with his family."
 
One final example for age 35 is "A married mother of two young children. She works as a nurse and enjoys spending her 
weekends going to the park with her family and trying out new recipes in the kitchen."
