## Usage

Nuggt provides a flexible and customizable way to automate tasks. The following sections explain the key aspects of using Nuggt.

### Prompt Template

Nuggt utilizes a step-by-step prompt template to define the actions required for task execution. Each step consists of the following elements:

- Step: A brief description of the current step.
- Reason: The reason behind taking this step.
- Action: The action to be performed, selected from the available tools.
- Action Input: The input required for the action.
- Observation: The result or output obtained from the action.

## Tool Integration

Nuggt offers seamless integration with various tools, allowing you to extend the functionality of your AI agents. The available tools include:

- Python: Execute Python scripts using a Python shell. Syntax: `{tool:python}`
- Document Tool: Process documents and retrieve answers to questions. Syntax: `{tool:document_tool}`
- Video Tool: Analyze videos and extract answers to questions. Syntax: `{tool:video_tool}`
- Google: Perform Google searches and retrieve relevant information. Syntax: `{tool:google}`
- Browse Website: Interact with websites, automate tasks, and extract data. Syntax: `{tool:browse_website}`
- Search: Get answers from google via SerperAPI. Syntax: `{tool:search}`
- LLM: Create LLM instance. Syntax: `{tool:llm}`
- Stable Diffusion: Generate images using Stable Diffusion. Syntax: `{tool:stable_diffusion}`
- Video Generation: Generate video from text. Syntax: `{tool:generate_video}`
- Caption: Caption images using SceneXplainAPI. Syntax: `{tool:image_caption}`
- Display: Print tables/visualisations to console. Syntax: `{tool:display}`


### Step-by-Step Execution

To execute a task using Nuggt, follow these steps:

1. Define a prompt using the following inputs:
   - `{text:<variable>}`: Create an input field and assign its value to `<variable>`
   - `{upload:<variable>}`: Create a file upload button and save the uploaded file by the name `<variable>`
   - `{tool:<tool_name>}`: Specify a tool to use. 

   For example: `Open {upload:document} using {tool:python} and display its content using {tool:display}`

2. Provide the necessary inputs and tools for each step, following the prompt format. Replace `<variable>` with any variable name.

3. Execute the task using Nuggt by clicking the submit button, which will process the prompt and perform the specified actions based on the inputs provided.

4. Review the observations and final answer generated by Nuggt to obtain the desired output.

By utilizing the `{tool:<tool_name>}` input format, you can seamlessly integrate various tools into your prompts, such as Python, document processing, video analysis, Google search, and web browsing. Combine these inputs with `{text:<variable>}` and `{upload:<variable>}` to create dynamic and interactive prompts tailored to your specific requirements.
