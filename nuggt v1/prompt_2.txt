Context: Here's the description of the user I am interviewing: {description}

The context is that I have the following hypotheses from hypothesis 13 to hypothesis 21. They are labelled as H13-H21 below.

H13: Family guys prioritise saving time over saving money
H14: Family guys prioritise saving time by shopping at a supermarket with a less crowded carpark.
H15: Family guys prioritise supermarkets that are nearer to their household.
H16: To save time, family guys are agnoistic to brands and look to purchase whichever groceries are most available and instock
H17: Family guys would prioritise shopping at supermarkets with less crowded checkouts.
H18: Family guys are influenced by deals, coupons, vouchers in their purchasing behavior.
H19: Family guys prefer bulk purchases over individual purchases.
H20: Family guys prioritize house brands over premium brands.
H21: Family guys prioritize good deals in-person over normal prices online.

For these hypotheses I want to generate this sort of response. For example,

If the description is, "A 46-year-old single mother of three teenagers, working as a high school teacher. 
Enjoys cooking healthy meals for her family and spends weekends attending her kids' sports events and exploring local farmers' markets."

"
General comments: Goes to Costco one a week with her family on the weekends and the local farmers market on the weekdays to buy organic food items.

H13: Validated. Money isn't a concern for her as long as the food she buys is healthy.
H14: Invalidated. She prefers less crowded areas.
H15: Validated. Prefers to go to Costco which is near her place.
H16: Invalidated. She cares about the brand she buys.
H17: Validated. She definitely prefers shorter queues and finds queueing the most time-consuming part of grocery shopping.
H18: Neutral. She would use a deal if the grocery item is something she really wants to buy.
H19: Validated. She prefers to buy in build because her kids more or less have the same eating habits.
H20: Validated. For basic groceries, house brands are preferred.
H21: Validated. She prefers to buy in person because going shopping as a fun activity she does with her kids.
"

So I want to generate this in the form,

General comments:

H14:
H15:
H16:
H17:
H18:
H19:
H20:
H21:

H24:

Each of the hypothesis responses must be printed on a new line.
